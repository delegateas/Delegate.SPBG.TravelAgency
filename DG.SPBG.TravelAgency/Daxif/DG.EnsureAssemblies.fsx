Ensure Assemblies
=================

Due to NuGets limitations when a VS project is restored, the "install.ps1" is not
executed and for this reason for this script, that will copy all the *.dll 
contained in the VS project "packages" folder to the folder containing the 
DAXIF# scripts

open System.IO

/// Executed only once in order to ensure .dll from nuget packages are copied to .lib
let root =  __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__
let pkgs = root + @"/.." + @"/packages"

/// Exclude older or portable .NET versions
let blacklist = [ "net20"; "portable-" ]
let exclude (path:string) = 
  blacklist |> List.fold(fun a y -> path.Contains(y) || a) false |> not
